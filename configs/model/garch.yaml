model_name: "garch"

# Model selection performed via grid search (scripts/garch_diagnostics.py)
# EGARCH(2,1)+skewt selected because:
#   1. Best BIC among models passing ARCH test (15407.9)
#   2. Passes ARCH residual test (p=0.831)
#   3. Passes Ljung-Box test (p=0.844)
#   4. Captures leverage effect (gamma=-0.163)
#
# Pre-fit diagnostics (all pass):
#   - ADF: p=0.000 (stationary)
#   - KPSS: p=0.100 (stationary)
#   - ARCH-LM: p=0.000 (ARCH effects present)
#   - Jarque-Bera: kurtosis=10.02 (use heavy-tailed distribution)

spec:
  p: 2              # ARCH order (lagged squared residuals)
  q: 1              # GARCH order (lagged variances)
  o: 1              # Leverage order (for EGARCH asymmetry)
  dist: "skewt"     # Skewed Student-t for fat tails + asymmetry
  mean: "constant"  # constant|zero
  vol: "EGARCH"     # EGARCH captures leverage effect
